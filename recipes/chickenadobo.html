    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>Peppercorns</li>
        <li>Green Onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned â€“ about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
        <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
        <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
